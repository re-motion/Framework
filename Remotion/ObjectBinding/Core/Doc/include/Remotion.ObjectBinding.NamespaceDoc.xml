      <summary>
    <para>
      The <B>Remotion.ObjectBinding</B> namespace contains interfaces for implementing a business object model with a 
      generic data definition and data access layer.
    </para><para>
      The data definition layer consists of the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectClass" />
      and the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectProperty" /> interface. These interfaces are used to 
      determine which the fields are exposed by an <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" /> instance.
    </para><para>
      While it is possible to simply program read and write access against the business object's get and set method,
      business object data binding is the true advantage gained by providing an object model with these interfaces.
    </para><para>
      The business object data binding connects an <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" /> with an
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundControl" />. If the control also implements
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundEditableControl" />, this connection is two way, 
      allowing both read and write access to the bound object.
    </para>

    <h3 class="dtH3">ObjectBinding, Mixins, and the Visual Studio Designer</h3>
    <para>
      <B>Remotion.ObjectBinding</B> is designed to work together with types mixed via <see cref="N:Remotion.Mixins"/>.
      Its standard implementation of the object binding interfaces is supplied by a mixin that is configured via 
      <see cref="Remotion.ObjectBinding.BindableObjectAttribute" /> and <see cref="Remotion.ObjectBinding.BindableObjectWithIdentityAttribute" />.
      That standard implementation also supports binding of properties added by other mixins.
    </para>
    <para>
      For the Visual Studio Designer, <B>Remotion.ObjectBinding</B> provides designer support for picking bindable types and for selecting bound
      properties and property paths. Due to a weakness in the way the designer loads types and assemblies at design time, the mixins applied
      to a target class in the built source code and the mixins applied to the same class in the designer might get out of sync.
    </para>
    <para>
      In such a case, the designer will either not show certain types or properties, although they are clearly marked as bindable and added by
      mixins in the source code; or it will display error messages about a certain class or property not being bindable, although it obviously is
      in the source code. Sometimes, simply refreshing the designer can resolve that issue, but sometimes the issue can only be resolved by
      restarting Visual Studio.
    </para>
    
    <h3 class="dtH3">The Business Object Model</h3>
    <h4 class="dtH4">Introduction</h4>
    <para>
      When implementing an object model using the CLS types, the object model is defined at compile time. 
      This is an advantage that is missing when interfacing with a highly dynamic system such as Fabasoft Components.
      The <b>Remotion.Coonet</b> framework provides the functionality required to access a Fabasoft Components domain 
      using <b>Business Object Binding</b>.
    </para><para>
      If the object model is defined at compile time but has to be accessed by a generic data access layer, this is 
      also a use case for <b>Business Object Binding</b>. Generic data access is required when data binding is involved, 
      for instance to use the web controls provided by the 
      <see cref="N:Remotion.ObjectBinding.Web"/> namespace.
    </para><para>
      In addition to these obvious problems, an application often requires a greater set of meta data than the CLS 
      types can provide by themselves. For instance, a CLS property can only provide its data type and the implicit 
      information as to whether it can be <see langword="null" />.
    </para>
    
    <h4 class="dtH4">The Remotion Business Object Model</h4>
    <para>  
      In order to provide both a dynamic object model and all the meta data required by an application, the 
      <b>Remotion.ObjectBinding</b> namespace provides a number of interfaces to represent a <b>Class</b>, a
      <b>Property</b>, and an <b>Object</b>.
    </para><para>
      The <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectClass" /> interface provides the properties available by
      an object of this class's type. It also provides services for accessing class specific meta data.
    </para><para>
      The <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectProperty" /> interface and its specializations for
      individual data types provide meta data about the fields contained in an <b>IBusinessObjectClass</b>. This meta 
      data includes information on whether the field is read-only, accessible, and contains a scalar value or a list of 
      values. For a complete description please refer to the documentation for the 
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectProperty" /> type.
    </para><para>
      The <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" /> interface represents an instance of a specific 
      <b>IBusinessObjectClass</b>. A business object knows its class and therfor the list <b>IBusinessObjectProperty</b> 
      available to get and set the business object's state.
    </para>
    
    <h3 class="dtH3">The Data Binding Process</h3>
    <h4 class="dtH4">Setting Up the Data Binding</h4>
    <para>
      In order to bind a business object to a control, an 
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectDataSource" /> is required. When configuring the data binding 
      during design-time, the data source must be provided with an 
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectClass" /> using a property custom to the individual 
      implementation of the data source. With the help of the business object class, it is possible to configure 
      the control's data binding inside the Visual Studio .NET Designer.
    </para><para>
      After the data source has been configured, each <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundControl" />
      must be provided with this data source. This is done by setting the control's
      <see cref="P:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundControl.DataSource" /> property. 
    </para><para>      
      Once the control's data source has been defined, the 
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectProperty" /> can be configured for each control. The 
      <see cref="P:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundControl.Property" /> member is used to determine which 
      field of the business object will be displayed and possibly edited with this control.
    </para>
    
    <h4 class="dtH4">Setting the Business Object</h4>
    <para>
      During run-time, the data source's 
      <see cref="P:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectDataSource.BusinessObject" /> 
      property is assigned an <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" />. 
    </para>
    
    <h4 class="dtH4">Loading the Business Object's Values</h4>
    <para>
      In the next step, the controls are loaded with the business object's values by calling the data source's 
      <see cref="M:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectDataSource.LoadValues(System.Boolean)" /> method with the 
      <b>interim</b> parameter set <see langword="false" />. 
      <note>
        See the remarks section of the 
        <see cref="M:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectDataSource.LoadValues(System.Boolean)" /> documentation for 
        further details on <b>interim</b>.        
      </note>
      <note type="caution">
        For a web application's subsequent page loads, the <b>interim</b> parameter must be set <see langword="true" />. 
      </note>
      When the data source's <b>LoadValues</b> method is executed, it loops through all controls bound to this 
      data source, calling each individual control's
      <see cref="M:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundControl.LoadValue(System.Boolean)" /> method in the process.
      <b>LoadValue</b> then uses the <see cref="P:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundControl.Property" /> 
      configured earlier to get the value to be displayed from the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" /> 
      connected to its data source.
      <note type="caution">
        The actual loading behavior depends on the value of the <b>interim</b> parameter passed during the 
        call of <b>LoadValues</b> and passed through to the <b>LoadValue</b> method.
      </note>
      <note>
        Please refer to the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.Web.UI.Controls.IBusinessObjectDataSourceControl" />'s
        documentation for an example of the <b>LoadValues Pattern</b>.
      </note>
    </para>
    
    <h4 class="dtH4">Saving the Business Object's Values</h4>
    <para>
      To save the values back into the business object connected to the data source, call its 
      <see cref="M:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectDataSource.SaveValues(System.Boolean)" /> method with the 
      <b>interim</b> parameter set <see langword="false" />.
      <note>
        See the remarks section of the 
        <see cref="M:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectDataSource.SaveValues(System.Boolean)" /> documentation for 
        further details on <b>interim</b>.        
      </note>
      When the data source's <b>SaveValues</b> method is exeucted, it loops through all controls bound to this 
      data source, calling the <b>SaveValue</b> method for each
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundEditableControl" /> found in the collection.
      <b>SaveValue</b> then uses the <see cref="P:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectBoundControl.Property" /> 
      configured earlier to write the control's current value back into the 
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" /> connected to its data source. 
      <note>
        It is important to ensure that all the controls' values are valid before executing <b>SaveValues</b>. 
        The reason for this is that an attempt to write invalid data back into the business object could result in 
        any number of invalid data exceptions thrown by the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" />
        implementation
      </note>
      <note>
        Please refer to the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.Web.UI.Controls.IBusinessObjectDataSourceControl" />'s
        documentation for an example of the <b>SaveValues Pattern</b>.

    <h3 class="dtH3">Implementing a New Business Object Model</h3>
    <h4 class="dtH4">Implementing the Object Model</h4>
    <para>
      To extend your object model with the business object interfaces, you have to create an implementation of the
      following interfaces: 
    </para><para>      
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObject" />, which provides a way of getting and setting the
      values of the object's fields. The business object is also capable of returning its type, the 
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectClass" />. If your object model provides an identity 
      (e.g. a GUID) for the business objects, it is recommended to extend your business object implementation with 
      the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectWithIdentity" /> interface. 
    </para><para>      
      <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectClass" />, which provides a list of the properties 
      exposed by a business object. If you implement <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectWithIdentity" />
      you must also implement the <see cref="T:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectClassWithIdentity" /> interface, 
      which allows you to retrieve a business object by using its 
      <see cref="P:Remotion.ObjectBinding.IBusinessObjectWithIdentity.UniqueIdentifier" />.
