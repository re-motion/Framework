# README Interface Mapping Test Domain

The interface mapping tests are located in Mapping/MappingReflectionIntegrationTests/InterfaceMapping instead of here in the test domain.

Instead of a big test domain the tests are split up into smaller tests, focusing on certain features.
Each test defines its own test domain and expected reference type definitions.
