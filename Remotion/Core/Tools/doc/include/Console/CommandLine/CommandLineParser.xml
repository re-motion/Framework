<CommandLineParser>
  <Parameters>
    <param name="includeFirstArgument">
      If <see langword="true"/>, the first argument (which is usually the file name of
      the program) is included, otherwise only the arguments after the first one are included.
    </param>
    <param name="commandLine">
        The string that contains the command line arguments. See <see cref="SplitCommandLine"/> for information on how command lines are parsed.
    </param>
  </Parameters>
  <SplitCommandLine>
    <param name="commandLine">The command line (as available from <see cref="System.Environment.CommandLine"/>.)</param>
    <returns>An array of command line arguments.</returns>
    <remarks>
      The following rules apply:
      <list type="bullet">
        <item>Use spaces to separate arguments.</item>
        <item>Embed arguments within double quotation marks to treat them as a single argument even if they contain 
        spaces.</item>
        <item>Within double quotation marks, use two double quotation marks if you need one double quotation mark in the 
        argument.</item>
      </list>
      This resembles the logic that is applied to the arguments of the C# Main method. However, the parameters passed to
      the Main method are parsed a little bit differently in special situations, according to an unknown and undocumented 
      algorithm.
    </remarks>
    <example>
      <list type="table">
        <listheader>
          <term>Command Line</term>
          <description>Parsing Result</description>
        </listheader>
        <item>
