  /// All attributes of the given base type or derived from it are filtered unless they are declared on the same level as the

  /// <code>
  /// [A ("Base")]
  /// [B ("Base")]
  /// [C ("Base")]
  /// class Base
  /// {
  /// }
  /// 
  /// [A ("Derived")]
  /// [B ("Derived")]

  /// [SuppressAttributes (typeof (A))]
  /// class Derived : Base
  /// {

  /// [A ("DerivedDerived")]
  /// [B ("DerivedDerived")]
  /// [C ("DerivedDerived")]
  /// class DerivedDerived : Derived
  /// {
  /// }
  /// 
  /// class A : Attribute { ... }
  /// class B : A { ... }
  /// class C : Attribute { ... }
  /// </code>
  /// <para>
  /// In this example, a call to GetCustomAttributes on typeof (DerivedDerived) would yield the following attributes:
  /// [C ("Base"), A ("Derived"), B ("Derived"), C ("Derived"), C ("DerivedDerived")].
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// [A ("Base")] and [A ("DerivedDerived")] are suppressed due
  /// to the <see cref="SuppressAttributesAttribute"/> on Derived's declaration. [B ("Base")] and [B ("DerivedDerived")] are also suppressed, because
  /// they inherit from A, which is suppressed. The C attributes are not suppressed because they are not related to A; [A ("Derived")] and 
  /// [B ("Derived")] are not suppressed because they are declared on the same level as the <see cref="SuppressAttributesAttribute"/>.
  /// </para>
  /// Do not suppress instances of <see cref="SuppressAttributesAttribute"/>.
