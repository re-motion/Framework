  /// This interface allows invokers with fixed arguments to be returned without references to their generic argument types. 
  /// </summary>
  /// <remarks>
  /// <p>Note that casting a <see cref="T:Remotion.Reflection.FuncInvoker"/> struct to an interface is a boxing operation, thus creating an object on the
  /// heap and garbage collecting it later. For very performance-critical scenarios, it be better to avoid this and accept the references to 
  /// the invoker's generic argument types.</p>
  /// <p>It is recommended to wrap this interface within a <see cref="FuncInvokerWrapper{TResult}"/>, because returning an interface could lead to 
  /// ambigous castings if the final call to <see cref="With{A1}"/> is missing, while using structs will usually lead to a compile-time error as 
  /// expected.</p>
  /// </remarks>
  /// <include file='../doc/include/Reflection/TypesafeInvoker.xml' path='TypesafeInvoker/Class/remarks'/>
