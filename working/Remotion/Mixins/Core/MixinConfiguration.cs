  /// <para>
  /// Instances of this class represent a single mixin configuration, ie. a set of classes associated with mixins. The class manages a thread-local
  /// (actually <see cref="SafeContext"/>-local) single active configuration instance via its <see cref="ActiveConfiguration"/> property and
  /// related methods; the active configuration can conveniently be replaced via the <see cref="EnterScope"/> method.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// <see cref="MixinConfiguration"/> also provides entry points for building new mixin configuration objects: <see cref="BuildNew"/>, 
  /// <see cref="BuildFromActive"/>, and <see cref="BuildFrom"/>.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// While the <see cref="MixinConfiguration.ActiveConfiguration"/> will usually be accessed only indirectly via <see cref="ObjectFactory"/> or 
  /// <see cref="TypeFactory"/>, <see cref="EnterScope"/> and the <see cref="BuildFromActive">BuildFrom...</see> methods can be very useful to adjust 
  /// a thread's mixin configuration at runtime.
  /// </para>
  /// <para>
  /// The master mixin configuration - the default configuration in effect for a thread if not specifically replaced by another configuration - is 
  /// obtained by analyzing the assemblies in the application's bin directory for attributes such as <see cref="UsesAttribute"/>,
  /// <see cref="ExtendsAttribute"/>, and <see cref="ComposedInterfaceAttribute"/>. (For more information about the default configuration, see
  /// <see cref="DeclarativeConfigurationBuilder.BuildDefaultConfiguration"/>.) The master configuration can be accessed via 
  /// <see cref="GetMasterConfiguration"/> and <see cref="SetMasterConfiguration"/>.
  /// </para>
  /// <example>
  /// The following shows an exemplary application of the <see cref="MixinConfiguration"/> class that manually builds mixin configuration instances
  /// and activates them for the current thread for a given scope.
  /// <code>
  /// class Program
  /// {
