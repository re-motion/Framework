  /// Completion detection is an important part of race condition prevention in web tests. When beginning a new action, we must be sure that the
  /// previous action has completed and the DOM is not modified anymore. Most other frameworks simply wait until the query for the DOM element in
  /// question succeeds and immediately start the interaction. However, that is especially not safe for ASP.NET WebForms pages where postbacks often
  /// display the very same DOM elements again.
