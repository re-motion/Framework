      // to reproduce code from the SecurityManager, to be able to decide beforehand, whether decideable access condtions
      // (e.g. specific tenant, specific user) will match or not. 
      // 
      // The "non-decideable" here refers to the information context of the AclExpander, which is lacking some information
      // available during normal SecurityManager access rights querying.
      // For decideable access conditons (e.g. specific tenant or specific group), the created SecurityToken
      // is not guaranteed to match, therefore the AccessTypeStatistics returned by Acl.GetAccessTypes are used to filter out these cases.

      // being shadowed by a 2nd, less restrictive ACE.

      // by another matching ACE in the current ACL (deny rights always win).
