Introduction
------------

You can download the latest officially signed, weekly or stable re-motion build 
from the Downloads section at www.re-motion.org. In most cases this is your best
option, since you can easily upgrade your re-motion version as new releases
become available. 

If however you want to build your own version of re-motion, either from 
Visual Studio or from the command line, this text will tell you how to go 
about this task. 

Important: Please note that to build your own version of re-motion you need to 
create your own key to sign your assembles. Please refer to 
"Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile" below on how to do this.


Getting re-motion
-----------------

To get the latest version of the re-motion source code, check it out from the 
SVN server (https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk/) 
(Note: The following examples assume that you check out the sourcecode into 
"c:\Remotion"; you can, of course, pick any other directory structure you like):

md c:\Remotion 
cd c:\Remotion 
svn checkout https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk/ trunk 

(To obtain the SVN tool, please go to http://subversion.tigris.org/; 
alternatively you can also use TortoiseSVN from http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ 
if you prefer a graphical user interface.) 


Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile
--------------------------------------

We cannot provide the official remotion.snk keyfile, so you will need to 
create your own.
To do so, simply run the "Generate-Snk.cmd" script from a Visual Studio Command 
Prompt. If you do not use a Visual Studio Command Prompt, you will need to make 
sure the .NET SDK is on your PATH.

cd c:\Remotion
Generate-Snk.cmd

Note that the newly generated key file will not match the original key used 
by rubicon to sign re-motion assemblies.


Building re-motion from Visual Studio
-------------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, just load Remotion.sln in 
Visual Studio and build it. It should work.

To run all the tests from NUnit, make sure you have a local installation of
SQL Server 2005. You might need to create C:\Databases and 
C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit tests work.


Building re-motion with MSBuild
-------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, run Build-RemotionLocal.cmd
from the re-motion trunk directory:

cd c:\Remotion
Build-RemotionLocal.cmd

As with the Visual Studio build, you need a local installation of 
SQL Server 2005 to run the full build. You might also need to create 
C:\Databases and C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit 
tests work.

To generate documentation files for re-motion, run Build-RemotionLocalDoc.cmd.
This requires Sandcastle Help File Builder to be installed, see below. 


Installing Sandcastle Help File Builder for the documentation build
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The installation package of the version of Sandcastle Help File Builder used by
re-motion is located in the prereq folder, under the following path: 

prereq\Tools\SandcastleHelpFileBuilderInstall\

Run Sandcastle Installer and click through the wizard.
- When asked whether to proceed without the Microsoft Help 2 Compiler 
  installed, click "Yes".
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Tools, click "Install Sandcastle".
- Also install the Sandcastle Patch by clicking "Apply Patch" from the
  appropriate wizard page.
- No additional language packs are required to build the re-motion
  documentation.
- The MAML guide, Web Project Custom Code Providers, HTML to MAML converter,
  and MAML Schema Intellisense may be helpful for writing documentation, but
  are NOT required for the re-motion build.
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Help File Builder, click "Install SHFB".
