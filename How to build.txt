Introduction
------------

You can download the latest officially signed builds of re-motion at
https://nuget.re-motion.org/feeds/re-motion-release/

If however you want to build your own version of re-motion, either from 
Visual Studio or from the command line, this text will tell you how to go 
about this task. 

Important: Please note that to build your own version of re-motion you need to 
create your own key to sign your assembles. Please refer to 
"Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile" below on how to do this.


Getting re-motion
-----------------

To get the latest version of the re-motion source code, check it out from 
Github at https://github.com/re-motion/Framework.

Note that the "Framework" repository only contains the history starting
with version 1.16.0 in 2015. To view the earlier history, check-out the 
"Framework-Archive" repository at https://github.com/re-motion/Framework-Archive.

You can also graft the repositories together by first checking out both
repositories into the same local copy and then using the git-replace command:
git replace --graft e9da3872012ac60583b703c2525ce3112a7f31f5 87c543e3daaf3f2746ca9dcbe08de8543408d30b


Creating your own remotion.snk keyfile
--------------------------------------

We cannot provide the official remotion.snk keyfile, so you will need to 
create your own.
To do so, simply run the "Generate-Snk.cmd" script from a Visual Studio Command 
Prompt. If you do not use a Visual Studio Command Prompt, you will need to make 
sure the .NET SDK is on your PATH.

cd c:\Remotion
Generate-Snk.cmd

Note that the newly generated key file will not match the original key used 
by rubicon to sign re-motion assemblies.


Building re-motion from Visual Studio
-------------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, just load Remotion.sln in 
Visual Studio and build it. It should work.

To run all the tests from NUnit, make sure you have a local installation of
SQL Server 2019. You might need to create C:\Databases and 
C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit tests work.


Building re-motion with MSBuild
-------------------------------

After getting the sources and a remotion.snk, run Build-RemotionLocal.cmd
from the re-motion trunk directory:

cd c:\Remotion
Build-Remotion.cmd

As with the Visual Studio build, you need a local installation of 
SQL Server 2019 to run the full build. You might also need to create 
C:\Databases and C:\Databases\ftdata directories by hand to make the unit 
tests work.

To generate documentation files for re-motion, run Build-Remotion.cmd
and select the "documentation" Option in the menu. The documentation build
requires Sandcastle Help File Builder to be installed, see below. 


Installing Sandcastle Help File Builder for the documentation build
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A backup of the installation package of the version of Sandcastle Help File Builder 
used by re-motion is located in the old Subversion repository:

https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk/prereq/Tools/SandcastleHelpFileBuilderInstall/v1.9.5.0/

Run Sandcastle Installer and click through the wizard.
- When asked whether to proceed without the Microsoft Help 2 Compiler 
  installed, click "Yes".
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Tools, click "Install Sandcastle".
- Also install the Sandcastle Patch by clicking "Apply Patch" from the
  appropriate wizard page.
- No additional language packs are required to build the re-motion
  documentation.
- The MAML guide, Web Project Custom Code Providers, HTML to MAML converter,
  and MAML Schema Intellisense may be helpful for writing documentation, but
  are NOT required for the re-motion build.
- When asked to install the Sandcastle Help File Builder, click "Install SHFB".
